# Portfolio Project - Code Review - Epicodus

For this project I created a webpage based on a portfolio of projects from my first week at Epicodus. This webpage was built from scratch using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap stylesheets.

## Getting Started

There are at least two ways of accessing the website. First and easiest is to follow the link https://spenceralan.github.io/Portfolio/ Second is to clone this repository onto your machine and open the index.html file in your web browser.

### Prerequisites

Web Browser

Examples: Chrome, Safari

### Installing

Installation is quick and easy! Either open this link https://spenceralan.github.io/Portfolio/ to see the webpage in action or cloan this repository to your machine and open the index.html file!
